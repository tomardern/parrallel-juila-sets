// "queenSocket" is a global variable that scripts running on queen have
// access to. It's the only variable introduced to this scope. This script
// will execute in it's own iframe so the global context is clean otherwise.

// The "onMessage" property allows the client-side script to listen
// to messages from the server-side script. In this case we're assuming
// the server script will only send us one message, and it'll be an integer
// for the maximum number we're should guess.
queenSocket.onMessage = function(maxNumber){
